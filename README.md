# Sandbox

You can just type text and it will be formatted.

Markdown also lets you use a bulleted list.
* one
* two
* three

And tables:
|Name|Favorite Animal|
|---|---|
|Carly|Long-beaked Echidna|

## Subheadings
Subheadings are useful to help you structure your documents.

Links start with square brackets around the link text and ellipse brackets around the URL. [here is a link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page)

You can find more markdown documentation on the [GitHub Markdown page](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).
